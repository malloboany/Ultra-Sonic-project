As a scientific calculation project we produce Ultra Sonic, which is a simulation of Gas movement after a sound wave.

We use Open GL library on C++ and simulate the gas as a balls which moves in a cube and collisions. Every ball collisions with walls and with another ball.
There is a source too, its task is to generate the wave as sinusoidal signal.

And there is a control panel to handle the physics and environment values, and show them.

Requirements:

-	Windows.

-	Open GL libraries.

-	Msvr120d.dll
